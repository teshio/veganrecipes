You basically just need a can of coconut milk 🥥, some veggies🥕🥦🌶, chickpeas and most importantly a good vegan curry paste 🙃. It’s ready in 15-25 minutes (depending on your knife skills 😄). I just served it with some millet as it cooks faster than rice 😊&lt;/p&gt;

I personally cook Indian or Asian dishes most of the time, because they’re mostly vegan anyway or can be made vegan fairly easy. However, sometimes I do want to enjoy something that is closer to the European kitchen that I grew up with. Here I’ll share a few of my favourite dishes. They range from energizing salads and pasta dishes to warming soups even a few treats.&lt;/p&gt;
