description: My favourite pasta is either Bavette a form of broader spaghetti, spaghetti or penne. I just feel long spaghetti and Bavette give this original Italian experience and there is nothing better than rolling up spaghetti covered in sauce with your fork â€” and you can still look elegant instead of just munching the pasta. Penne are great because their grooved sides hold on to more sauce and make the pasta even tastier. In this chapter I'll share my favourite sauces with you and recommend the best pasta for each, however if you're a sinner and haven't already stocked up on Bavette, Spaghetti and Penne you might also use other pasta instead!
