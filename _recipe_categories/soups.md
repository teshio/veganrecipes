title: Comforting Soups
category_id: 3
description: For me soups are a winter and autumn dish... I can't eat them if it's over 15 degrees outside, sometimes I am almost sad, if I realise the season for soups is over. At the same time I basically seem to live on a soup-diet during winter! As I am someone who feels cold most of the time, a particularly enjoy the warming and soothingly filling feeling of a bowl (or two or even three?) of soup. The only soup I might eat during summer is a tomato soup, because it has such a nice and fruity taste!
