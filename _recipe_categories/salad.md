description: There is no better feeling than to nourish your body with a colurful salad. I personally love eating salads for lunch as they keep me satisfied and full until dinner, without the food coma a heavy meal would cause. So they're perfect with you if you want a quick lunch that will keep your energy levels up for the rest of your working day and you can easily prep them as well!
