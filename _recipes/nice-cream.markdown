1.	Add the frozen bananas to your food processor. It is important that they're cut into coins, as this will make it easier for your food processor.
2.	Add a minimal amount of plant milk to your food processor and try blending the bananas for 1-2 minutes. If your food processor struggles, gradually add more plant milk, but be patient!
3.	Once you've reached the desired consistency, add your flavourings and process until theVre well incorporated.
4.	You can either eat the ice cream straight away or freeze it again for 1-2 hours so that you can scoop it out like ben and jerry's ice cream. Add your desired toppings (chocolate chips, fresh fruit, nuts, shredded coconut) on top and enjoy!
