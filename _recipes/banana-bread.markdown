description: This banana bread is heavenly! It fluffy, a little moist and tastes so indulgent. It's a great after dinner treat (with some cheeky nice cream or actual ice cream if you're feeling extra fancy) or tastes great with some afternoon tea. I've taken this to many barbecues and everyone has loved it so far.

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Bread
    items:
      - 250g all purpose flour
      - 120g brown sugar
      - 3 tsp baking powder
      - 1/2 tsp salt
      - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
      - 3 medium ripe bananas (with black spots)
      - 120ml plant milk
      - 3 Tbsp coconut oil (or other neutral oil)
      - 1 flax egg (1 TBL ground flax seeds + 3 TBL hot water)
      - 200g vegan dark chocolate

1.	Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.
2.	Add the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon to a mixing bowl and mix well.
3.	Melt the coconut oil by placing it in a cup and then placing the cup into a bowl with hot water (previously boiled in the kettle). Give it 2 minutes and then stir to dissolve completely.
4.	Make your flax egg by combining the ground flax seeds with the hot water and let sit for 2 minutes to thicken up. The mixture will look gloopy.
5.	Add the bananas, the plant milk, coconut oil and sugar to your food processor and blend until smooth.
6.	Chop the chocolate into small chunks.
7.	Add the banana mixture to your dry ingredients, also add the flax egg. Mix until combined, the batter will be quite thick.
8.	Gently fold in the chocolate chips.
9.	Grease a 12 x 22 cm loaf form and pour the batter in.
10.	Place into the oven and bake for around 60-70 minutes, until a knife inserted into the centre comes out clean.
11.	I find this tastes awesome if it's still warm with some ice cream, but it is also great days later!
Sometimes I cut it into slices and freeze it. Then you can just pop a slice into the toaster when you feel like it and enjoy.
