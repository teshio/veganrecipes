description: Do you sometimes miss having eggs in some form? Be it poached, boiled, fried or scrambled. Admittedly, it's a bit tough to replace them... It's easy in cakes or cookies and even pancakes, but there's nothing that has quite the same texture. However, I have found that this scramble satisfies my egg-craving really well! The black salt gives it the slightly eggy taste and nutritional yeast as well as plant milk help to achieve similar creaminess. I do find this scramble tastes best on toasted rye bread that is topped with creamy guacamole. A perfect breakfast for the weekend if you feel like something hearty and have a little bit of time. But I also find it makes a great high protein dinner after a workout.

1.	Finely chop the onion and the garlic.
2.	Drain the tofu and transfer to a bowl. Now use a fork to mash the tofu. You want to make really tiny crumbs, so that the tofu resembles the texture of scrambled egg, but also to ensure, that it soaks up the liquids and taste.
3.	Wash the tomatoes and cut them in halves. Also was the spinach/kale and pat dry.
4.	To a huge pan on medium heat add the oil, onion and garlic. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes and then add the tomatoes.
5.	While the tomatoes are cooking (you want them to go soft and almost mushy) make the "egg"- sauce: Add the soy/almond milk along with nutritional yeast, turmeric, paprika, black salt and pepper to a bowl and whisk until combined. It is important to not use oat milk or a sweetened plant milk in this recipe, as it would ruin the taste!
6.	Once the tomatoes are almost cooked, add the tofu and let it cook for 5 another minutes, until the tofu is warmed through. If the pan gets really dry, add some water to deglaze. Then add the "egg"sauce and mix well. You might want to add more black salt for an "eggier" taste, but be careful as this will make your dish more salty as well. Lastly, add the spinach and stir in.
6. Serve with rye bread and creamy guacamole and on top. Or just some avocado slices or hummus!
