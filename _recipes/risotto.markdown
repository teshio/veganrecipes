description: Some people think it's impossible to achieve a cream and rich risotto without cheese and butter, but this will convince that that't not true! It it really important to use the right rice here and be patient! ... you have to keep stirring and stirring adding only more liquid once the rice has soaked up all the moisture.

1.	Chop garlic and shallot finely. Cut courgettes into chunks and the mushrooms into discs.
2.	Add the oil to a pot on medium high heat. Add garlic, shallots and garlic and saut√© the onion for 3-5 minutes, make sure not to brown them, add water if needed.
3.	Once the shallots are translucent, add the soy sauce and let it reduce for 1 minute. Then add the courgettes and mushrooms. Let them cook for about 5 minutes until
they start to soften, but aren't completely cooked.
4.	While the veg is cooking, chop the parsley and toast the pine nuts over medium high heat for 5-7 minutes. Set both aside to top your risotto later.
5.	Next add the rice and let it soak up any excess liquid from the veg and then add your first 1/2 cup of vegetable broth (make it by boiling  water in a kettle and add the granules). Lower the heat to medium-low. Now the critical part begins: You have to keep stirring and you must not add any additional liquid until the rice looks almost dry.
6.	Now add about h cup of liquid at a time, I like to add wine at the third time to make sure the flavour is noticeable.
7.	Once you've added all the liquid and the rice has soaked up all of it, check if the rice is done. It should be a bit mushy, but still be a bit al dente in middle of the grain. If not you'll have to keep adding additional stock. Once the rice is done, add the nutritional yeast and mix well, add some more salt and black pepper to taste.
8.	Serve a portion of risotto to four bowls, top with parsley and pine nuts and serve! As risotto is quite rich it might be nice to have a side salad on the side.
