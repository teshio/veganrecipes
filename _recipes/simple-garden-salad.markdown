description: This salad is a great side for any heavy meal, because it is light and fresh. I personally just love raw cocktail tomatoes, they're a must in any salad. However, the trickiest part is the dressing, if it's not good, the salad won't taste at all, but if it's good you might just eat the whole bowl and forget about your main! Sometimes I'll add some pan-fried tofu or beans to this salad and have it as a main with some toasted rye bread on the side... perfect if it's hot outside and you feel like have something refreshing.

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Salad
    items:
      - 1-2 romaine lettuces (depending on the size)
      - 250g cocktail tomatoes
      - 1 small shallot
      - 1 avocado
  - top-level: Dressing
    items:
      - 6 TBL of olive oil
      - 3 TBL of balsamic vinegar (use lemon juice instead)
      - 1	tsp. of Dijon mustard
      - 1-2 tsp. of maple syrup (replace with honey)
      - salt and pepper to taste

1.	Cut and wash the romaine lettuce. I find it easiest to cut out the stem and then cut the lettuce into small chunks before washing it. Wash and pat dry.
2.	Wash the tomatoes and cut them in halves. Finely chop the shallot and add both to a bog salad bowl.
3.	Cut the avocado in half and remove the stone. Use your knife to cut lengthwise and then horizontally through the flesh. Scoop out the chunks into the salad bowl.
4.	Mix all the ingredients for the dressing together in a cup or jar and adjust with salt, pepper and maybe some sweetener.
5.	Pour the dressing over your salad just before serving, otherwise the lettuce will be wilted.
6.	Enjoy as a side or add some smoked tofu/beans and quinoa or potato wedges to make it a complete meal.
