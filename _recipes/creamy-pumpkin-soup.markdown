description: This soup is just perfect! It achieves a creamy and rich texture without any nasty ingredients and I also find the ginger and curry powder gives it tiny Asian twist. It's flavourful and ridiculously easy to make.

1.	Finely chop the onion.
2.	Cut your pumpkin in quarters and scoop out the seeds. Then cut the pumpkin and the peeled potatoes into small chunks, about the same size.
3.	To a huge pot on medium high heat, add the oil and the onion to saut√©. Once it's translucent, add the ginger and cook for another minute. Then add the curry powder and fry it for 30 seconds to a minute.
4.	Add the potatoes and pumpkin. Ideally, you want to coat them in the onion-garlic-curry mixture, before adding the vegetable stock. It should hardly cover the veggies and cover the pot with a lid. Now let the soup simmer for 15-20 minutes.
5.	While the soup is simmering, cut up the mushrooms and courgettes into discs and fry them on medium high with the oil until the're slightly browned. Flip them in between. Add salt and pepper and set them aside
6.	Once 15 minutes have passed, check the texture of the potato and pumpkin. They should be soft, if not give them a little bit longer. If they're done add the coconut milk and blend with an immersion blender. If you are worried that you have too much liquid, try to spoon out some of the broth before adding the coconut milk, because we can always add it back in. Adjust the taste by using salt and lime juice.
7.	Toast rye bread twice to make it extra crispy. Serve the soup and add the fried veggies on top and some bread to the side. Enjoy!
