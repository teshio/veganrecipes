description: This salad is a homage to all the great picknicks we had as a family. We would make sandwiches, this salad and take some fruit with us. After cycling for a while and balling badminton or volleyball we would sit down and enjoy this in the sun on a pick-nick blanket. This version uses smoked tofu as bacon replacement. It's a really good light dinner on hot days or a great addition to any barbecue or vegan burgers! Sometimes I like to add 500g of cherry tomatoes for sweetness or 500g of radishes for freshness, but the recipe is great as it is... Try and see for yourself!

1.	Peel the potatoes and cook whole (!) them until tender (about 20-25 minutes). Drain and set aside to cool.
2.	Finely chop the shallots and cut the cucumber(s) into small chunks. Add both to a large (or two) bowls.
3.	Cut the tofu into cubes and chop the dill is you use fresh one. If you are using dried dill, add it to the dressing.
4.	Mix the ingredients for the dressing apart from the vegetable stock (!) together in a cup or jar and adjust with salt, pepper.
5.	Once the potatoes have cooled down, cut them into disks and add to the salad bowl(s).
6.	Pour the dressing and the vegetable stock over and mix well. Then add the fresh dill and the tofu cubes and mix carefully (you don't want to break too many potato disks!)
7.	Cover with a lid or some foil and put the salad in the fridge. Leave the salad in the fridge for at least 2 hrs or even overnight. Take out 10 minutes before serving and enjoy.
