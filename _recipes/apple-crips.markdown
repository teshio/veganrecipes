description: I love these... I used to be addicted to store bought ones, but let me tell you they're even better homemade! They bring back memories to hiking holidays in the mountains of South Tyrol and offer the nice crunch that makes potato crisps so addictive. Sometimes I like to dip them into a bit of almond butter if I'm feeling extra indulgent. But beware; this recipe requires patience and time. So it's best to make these when you're doing home office, cleaning the house or just have a lazy Sunday.

1.	Preheat your oven to 85 degrees.
2.	Wash the apples and core them. For this you can use an apple corer. If you don't have one follow the instructions under 3.
3.	Cut the apples into disks, trying to make them as thin as possible or use a slicer. Then use a knife to cut out the core. Repeat until all apples are cut und cored.
4.	Spread the apple disks on to a tray lined with parchment paper and use a brush to brush with a little bit of lemon juice. This is to prevent them from turning brown, but do not use too much otherwise the apple crisps will taste sour.
5.	Now put the tray(s) into the oven. I sometimes use four trays at the same time and it has always worked.
6.	This is very important: your oven must not be completely closed, I use a wooden spoon that I put in the oven door, to leave it open just a tiny bit. This is necessary because the apples are drying and you want the excess moisture to evaporate.
7.	Leave the apples in there for a total of 5-7 hours. After 3 hours, I take them out, flip them (carefully), brush the other side with lemon juice and then switch the tray positions. If you have sliced them really thin, they might be done after 5 hours. The best way to check this is to take them out (even if they still feel a bit soft) leave them out for 5 minutes and then check if they feel crispy. If not, but them back in!
8.	Store them in airtight containers for up two 3 weeks. But make sure, they are really dry and cooled
