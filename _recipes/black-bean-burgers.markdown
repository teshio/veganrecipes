description: If I really feel like treating myself, I'll make a batch of those and serve them with creamy guacamole and some oven baked potato wedges. They are so flavourful and yummy that I'm not even ashamed to serve them to some of my meat-eating and bean-hating friends. So far, everyone has liked them. I personally oppose the usage of vegan cheese, I find it disgusting and it is almost as unhealthy and calorific as the original (most vegan cheese is made form coconut oil). The guacamole works great as a replacement and some sautéed red onions and grilled veg add some much flavour that cheese is really not needed -Take it from someone you never had a burger without cheese before going vegan.

1.	Drain the black beans and let them sit in a sieve while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
2.	Finely chop garlic and onion. Heat a small pan to medium heat and add 1 TBL of oil. Add garlic and onion and sauté until they're soft, you must not brown them.
3.	Add the walnuts to food processor and pulse until crumbly. Set them aside in a mixing bowl.
4.	Add the sautéed onion and garlic to the food processor along with the black beans, all the spices and the tomato paste. Pulse and scrape down the sides and pulse again. Depending on your food processor this might take some time, but it's worth it! Make the mixture as smooth as possible.
5.	Add the mixture to the mixing bowl and also add the flour. Mix in. If the mixture still seems very wet when you touch it, add more flour. Start by adding 1 TBL at a time.
6.	Flour a big cutting board, baking tray or plate and then divide the batter into for equal portions. I always add more flour to the outside of the patties as it is easier handle them when they're floured.
7.	Form the portions into patties by rolling them into a ball and then flattening with a bit of parchment paper over top using the base of a glass.
8.	Put the baking tray with the patties into the freezer for 30 minutes or into the fridge for 2 hrs. Use the time to prepare your extras!
9.	Cut your red onions (l use at least two) into rings. Add to a pan with 1 TBL of oil and sauté for 5 minutes until soft. Set aside in a bowl to top your burger with them later.
10.	Add the 2 TBL of oil to a frying pan and heat until hot. Add in all four burgers if your pan is big enough, otherwise do them in two batches. Fry for 5 minutes on one side and then flip. Brush the tops and sides of the burgers with vegan barbecue sauce. Fry for 5 minutes on the other side and then remove from the pan.
11.	Now assemble your burger: Put some barbecue sauce on to the bottom of the hamburger bun, add your patty, put some guacamole on the patty. Then add lettuce, pickles, onion, veg and tomatoes. I like to serve the simple garden salad and some oven baked wedges as sides. Enjoy!
12.	Tip: you can also batch make these patties and freeze them. Just take them out the night before and put them into the fridge.
