description: My dad makes the most epic chocolate mousse, but it's not vegan O! I found this recipe, and I do have to say that this is quite a good replacement. The bonus; it's really easy to make and even qualifies as a high protein treat since we're using silken tofu!

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Chocolate Mousse
    items:
      - 300g silken tofu
      - 1 TBL cornflour
      - 50g cocoa powder
      - 1 good pinch of salt
      - 1 TBL vanilla extract
      - 6 TBL maple syrup
      - 120 ml plant milk

  - top-level: Veg
    items:
      - 300g mixed frozen berries
      - 1/2 cup of water
      - 1 TBL ground flaxseeds
      - 2-3 TBL of sweetener

1.	Add all the ingredients to your food processor and pulse until smooth.
2.	Now add the mixture a pan and gently heat up. Keep stirring continuously. As the mixture starts to thicken up, turn off the heat and fill into four glasses. Let the mousse set for at least 4 hrs in the fridge.
3.	Make the berry sauce by adding the berries to a pan and gently heating up. You might want to add about 1/2 cup of water, but be patient as the berries will start to release their juices and you don't want your sauce to get soupy. Once the mixture has come to a boil, reduce add flaxseeds to thicken the mixture and your sweetener.
4.	To serve I like to put some berry sauce on top of the mousse. If you're too lazy to make the berry sauce, fresh berries or pomegranate seeds are great toppings to this. Enjoy as dessert or high protein snack!
