1.	Cut the aubergines into about lcm cubes and salt them with about 1 tsp salt. Massage the salt into the aubergines. This will help to soften them and reduce any water that may thin the sauce later on. While the aubergine softens, chop onion and garlic.
3.	To a large pan on medium high heat add 3 TbL of oil and the aubergine cubes. Let them cook for about 3-5 minutes until the aubergines start to brown.
4.	Add garlic, onion and chili and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Make sure that the onions become translucent, but nothing burns. You may add water if you feel like everything will burn.
5.	Add the tomatoes and lower the heat. Let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile bring the water for the pasta to a boil and tidy up.
6.	When the water is boiling add salt (about 2 tsp.) and the pasta. Cook it according to the packaging. As the pasta is boiling, season the sauce with sugar, salt and pepper.
8.	Once the pasta is al dente, strain it, put it back into the pot and drizzle with 2 TBL of olive oil. Mix with well to keep the pasta from sticking together.
9.	Serve the pasta into four bowls (reserving some in the pot) and pour the sauce on top. You can sprinkle some nutritional yeast on top and enjoy!
