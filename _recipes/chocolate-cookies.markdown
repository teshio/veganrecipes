description: I really love these cookies... I have stopped making them, because I just end up eating the whole batch and you might find yourself doing that, too!

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Cookies
    items:
      - 70g desiccated coconut
      - 2/3 cup almonds
      - 10 TBL pure maple syrup
      - 4 TBL coconut oil
      - 6 TBL cocoa powder
      - 4 TBL almond butter
      - 6-8 TBL almond milk
      - 1 tsp. bicarbonate of soda

1.	Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.
2.	Place the desiccated coconut and the almonds into your food processor and pulse until they have a fine consistency like flour.
3.	Place all the dry ingredients (almond-coconut flour, cocoa powder, salt, cinnamon and bicarbonate of soda) into a bowl and mix well.
4.	Melt the coconut oil by placing it in a cup and put the cup in a pot with hot water. While the oil is melting, chop the chocolate.
5.	Mix all the wet ingredients (maple syrup, coconut oil, almond butter, almond milk, vanilla extract) together.
6.	Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ones by using a whisk or fork. Once they're well incorporated, fold in the chocolate chips.
7.	Take a spoon and scoop out some of the dough onto a tray lined with baking paper. I sometimes this dough to quite sticky and difficult to handle. It can be easiest to handle it with wet hands: Place a bowl with cold water next to the bowl with the dough and your tray. Use your hands to form a ball out of a tablespoon portion of dough. Then use your hands to press the ball down into a cookie shape. Wet your hands again and repeat until all dough is used up.
8.	Bake for roughly 8-10. For a chewier cookie bake slightly less (7-8 minutes) and 10 minutes for a crispy cookie. Take out and let set for at least 20 minutes, otherwise the cookies fall apart as you try to lift them.
9.	I like(d) to batch make these and freeze them, the taste awesome even straight out of the freezer! Or leave them out for 15 minutes to soften. Enjoy with ice cream, tea or just by themselves!
