description: This salad makes it possible to eat broccoli in a salad! Eat some cooked chickpeas or smoked tofu on the side to give you some extra protein. This salad offers plenty of antioxidants, vitamins, fiber and is still tasty â€” if that's not a win then I don't know...

1.	Rinse the quinoa, put in a pot with double the amount of water (3 cups) and bring it to a boil.
2.	Bring water to boil in another large pot. You will use this pot for the broccoli heads, so maybe use two pots if you're struggling.
Salt the water when it starts to boil.
3.	Once the quinoa starts to boil, let it cook for 5 minutes on high heat and then lower the heat and cover it partially with a lid. Let it simmer another 10-15 minutes until the water is gone and the quinoa is cooked. Remove the quinoa from the stove.
4.	While the while the broccoli water comes to a boil, wash the tomatoes and cut them in half.
5.	Finely chop the shallot, cut the smoked tofu into cubes.
6.	Dry roast the pine nuts on low heat for 5-7 minutes until they're slightly browned.
7.	Cut of the bottom of the broccoli heads and add the broccoli head(s) to the boiling salted water. Cook for six minutes. Test with a knife. The broccoli should still be a bit crunchy, remove from the stove and rinse with cold water immediately.
8.	Cut the broccoli into small florets and the stem into small chunks.
9.	Make your dressing by whisking the ingredients together.
10.	Assemble your salad: Add the cut shallots, the tomatoes, the broccoli and the quinoa to a huge salad bowl. Add the dressing and give it a good mix. Put pine nuts and smoked tofu in separate small bowls so you can top your portion with them.
11.	Enjoy!
