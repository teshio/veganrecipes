description: This is one of my favourite homemade spreads... it's so versatile. You can add this into your sandwiches, dip your oven baked chips in it, put it on top of your burger.

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Soup
    items:
      - 1 medium avocado
      - juice of half a lime
      - 2 garlic cloves

1.	Add all ingredients to your food processor and pulse until smooth.
2.	You might have to add more lime juice and salt, depending on the taste of your avocado. I like to be cautious here, as you can always add more, but once there's too much lime, salt or garlic in there, it's difficult to remedy that!
3.	Serve however you like. You can also store this into the fridge and eat the next day. However, due to oxidation it top will be brown. But most likely it will be eaten up, so no worries!
