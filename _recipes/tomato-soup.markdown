description: I only made this recipe once, because I convinced myself to also make the ciabatta myself... which was a ridiculous amount of effort. But the soup was really good and I keep think about making it again, this is one of the few soups, I actually would like to eat in the summer. I love the fruity taste of the tomatoes, it is even more intensified as the roasted in this recipe. Tomatoes are my favourite vegetable (although the're actually a fruit!) and I've had many tomato soups in restaurants lately, only to be disappointed, because they're no match for this recipe... I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

1.	Preheat the oven to 200C.
2.	Halve the tomatoes and place cut-side up on a tray lined with parchment paper.
3.	Break the garlic bulb into cloves. Chop the onions and place both onto the tray.
4.	Sprinkle with oregano, season with salt and black pepper, then drizzle with oil. Roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the tomatoes are soft and sticky.
5.	Scrape everything from the tray into a large pan. Pick out the garlic cloves and squeeze the flesh out, then discard the skins.
6.	Pour the stock in, then roughly chop and add the basil stalks with most of the leaves. Bring to slight simmer.
7.	Add 1 TBL of red wine vinegar to the soup, then blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
8.	You can toast the ciabatta with you want: cut it into slices and then brush with a little bit of olive and add on to a baking tray or into a griddle pan for 5-10 minutes.
9.	Serve into bowls, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, decorate with a few basil leaves and serve ciabatta as side.
