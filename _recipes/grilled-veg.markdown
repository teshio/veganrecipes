description: This is a staple for me... It's not even a real dish, but as it is used so often, it definitely deserves a page! I add this to my burgers as topping, soups, pizza or some sandwiches. However, it also tastes great as antipasti with a pre-dinner drink!

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Veg
    items:
      - 3 TBL of oil
      - 3 courgettes
      - 2 bell peppers
      - 250g mushrooms
      - salt and pepper to taste

1.	Chop your courgettes into disks, bell pepper into cubes and the mushrooms into disks.
2.	To a pan on medium high heat, add 2 TBL of oil along with the bell pepper and fry for 5 minutes. Then add the courgettes.
3.	Once the courgettes and bell peppers are done, season them with salt and pepper. Add onto a plate.
4.	Use kitchen roll to clean out your pan. Then put back onto the stove and add the remaining 1 TBL of oil along with mushrooms. Fry them for 5-7 minutes and then season!
5.	Serve and enjoy! I like to make these in batches so that I can add these to sandwiches and salads.
