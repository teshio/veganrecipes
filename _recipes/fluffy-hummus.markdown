description: What is the secret of really good hummus? It's the order in which you put the ingredients into your food processor... I could not believe how easy it is! And you really need to add olive and some water... It makes a big difference. If you are feeling extra fancy, you can peel your chickpeas to make the hummus even more fluffy, but I personally find that tedious and unnecessary.

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Hummus
    items:
      - 1 can chickpeas
      - 1/4 cup (60ml) lemon juice
      - 1/4 cup (60ml) tahini
      - 1	garlic clove
      - 1/2 tsp. fine sea salt or to taste
      - 2	to 4 TBL ice water
      - 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
      - 2 TBL extra-virgin olive oil

1.	Drain and rinse your chickpeas. Finely chop your garlic clove.
2.	Now (importantly!) add the tahini and the lemon juice to the food processor and pulse for 30 seconds. Then scrape down the sides and pulse for another 30 seconds. You want the two ingredients to be well combined: they should form a thick paste.
3.	Now proceed by adding one ingredient at a time and pulsing for a full minute before (!!) adding the next one. I like to put them in in this order: cumin, salt, garlic, olive oil.
4.	When you're adding the chickpeas, start by adding half of the batch, process for a minute and then add the second half and process for another minute.
5.	Your hummus is almost done now, it will be a little bit tough though. Start by adding 2 TBL of water and process. If your hummus is still not smooth enough, add another 2 TBL and process again. Keep doing this until you've reached your desired level of smoothness. For me 2-4 TBL seems to be the amount I need.
6.	Store this in an airtight container for up to 5 days. You might want to add some extra olive oil on top if you store it in the fridge as this will keep it from drying out.
7.	Serve as snack with carrot and bell pepper sticks, add to your sandwiches or dip your chips in there. Get creative and enjoy!
