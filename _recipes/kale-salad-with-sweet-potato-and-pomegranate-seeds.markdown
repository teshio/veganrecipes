description: You'll love this salad for its vibrant colour and the satisfying feeling afterwards. I love the combination of the sweetness from pomegranate seeds and sweet potato and then the slightly bitter taste of kale. The tomatoes help to give this salad a fruity note! A mixture of textures and different tastes that give you the best of both; healthy eating and taste!

1.	Preheat your oven to 180C. Wash and peel the sweet potatoes. Cut them into cubes and put them on a baking sheet. Pour 2 TBL oil and curry powder over the cubes and use your fingers to coat the cubes evenly. Put them into the oven for about 20-30 minutes and then check.
2.	Rinse the quinoa, put in a pot with double the amount of water (3 cups) and bring it to a boil.
3.	Once the quinoa starts to boil, let it cook for 5 minutes on high heat and then lower the heat and cover it partially with a lid. Let it simmer another 10-15 minutes until the water is gone and the quinoa is cooked. Remove the quinoa from the stove.
4.	Finely chop garlic and shallot and add them to a pan on medium high heat with 1 TBL of oil. Let the shallot saut√© for about 4 minutes.
5.	Add tomatoes and kale to the pan and cook until the kale is slightly welted. Then add to a large bowl and mix with the sweet potatoes once they're done.
6.	Combine the contents of the dressing and whisk until smooth, adding more water as needed to make the dressing runnier.
7.	Serve the salad in four bowls, sprinkle with pomegranate seeds, use a spoon to drizzle about a quarter of the dressing on top of each. And add half a cup of quinoa on the side. Enjoy !
