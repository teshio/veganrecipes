description: This soup is one of my favourites. It's simple, but good and reminds me of my childhood. My mum used to make it with roux (a combination of flour and butter to thicken the soup) and some sausages. No butter and sausage in this recipe, but believe you won't miss them! smoked tofu makes a great replacement for the sausages and just mash a few of the potato chunks at the end to make the soup a bit thicker. I honestly eat this at least once a week from October until January. Try it and you'll understand why... Potatoes are life!

1.	Finely chop the onions.
2.	Peel potatoes and cut them into small chunks, about the same size. Peel and cut the carrots as well.
3.	To a huge pot on medium heat, add the oil and the onions to sauté. This should take some time. The onions must not go brown, instead they should go soft and bit yellow, but be translucent at the same time. Sauté them for about 5 minutes.
4.	Add the potatoes and carrots. Ideally, you want to cook them for 1-2 minutes, before adding the vegetable stock. If the pan goes really dry, add a little stock. Then add all of the stock along with the bay leaves and juniper berries. Add a lid and let simmer for 20-25 minutes.
5.	While the soup is simmering, cut the tofu into cubes and set aside in a bowl. Drain the sundried tomatoes (if using them) and put in a separate bowl.
6.	Also wash and chop the parsley.
6.	Once 20 minutes have passed, check the texture of the potatoes and the carrots. They should be soft, but not totally mushy. Just fish out some stock with a little bit of potato and carrot to try. If you like their texture add salt to taste. Use a potato masher, to mash some of the potato chunks for a slightly creamier texture.
7.	Serve the soup in deep bowls and add your garnishes. Now you can start to enjoy the warming feeling!
