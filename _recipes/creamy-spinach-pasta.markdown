description: As a child I loved creamed spinach... At times I would just have the frozen creamed spinach for dinner, sometimes with pasta, sometimes with a fried egg and potatoes or just by itself... So this brings back memories of my earliest cooking days, but I've made a few tweaks to make it tastier and a bit more like a real dish and not just warmed up frozen stuff... Saying this, feel free to use frozen spinach instead!

1.	Chop onion and garlic finely.
2.	To a large pan on medium high heat add 3 TBL of oil and the chopped garlic and onion. Let them cook for about 3-5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Be careful not to brown the onion!
3.	Once the onion is translucent, you can add the spinach and about h tsp. of salt. It will look dry at first, but the spinach will start to lose water quickly. Lower the heat of the sauce and put the water for the pasta on the stove.
4.	When the water starts to boil, add 3 tsp. of salt and the pasta. Cook according to instructions.
5.	Once the spinach is wilted, add salt, vegan cream. lemon and nutritional yeast. Start with a little bit of cream, you don't want the sauce to be too soupy.
6.	Season the sauce with additional salt, pepper and nutritional yeast.
7.	When the pasta is al dente, strain it, put it into the pan with the spinach sauce and mix well.
9. Serve the pasta into four bowls (reserving some in the pan) and enjoy!
