description: A friend of mine made this dish for me and I have to say, I was hooked! It works warm as well as cold and is perfect for summer evenings. It also changes up things a little bit as the veg is prepared in the oven, so you don't have to stir in the pasta sauce for 20 minutes while starving.

serves: 4
time: 60
ingredients:
  - top-level: Grilled Veg
    items:
      - 3 medium courgettes
      - 3 medium bell peppers
      - 2 red onions
      - 3 TBL oil
      - salt and pepper to taste

  - top-level: Pasta
    items:
      - 500g Penne (or other short pasta, do not use spaghetti here!)
      - 2-3 litres of water
      - 3 tsp. salt
      - green pesto

1.	Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
2.	Cut the courgettes into disks, dice the peppers and slice the onions (do not chop them, cut them in half and then slice them lengthwise).
3.	Put the veg on to a baking tray lined with parchment paper or two trays, it is important that the tray is not Ucrowded" as this will cause the veg to just go soft and not really roast.
4.	Drizzle oil on top, sprinkle salt and pepper and use your hands to coat the veg evenly and then spread.
5.	Put the tray(s) into the oven and let the veg roast for 15 minutes. Then check and stir a little bit using a spatula and roast for another 10-15 minutes until the veg starts to slightly brown. You can use this time to tidy up and cook your pasta.
6.	Cook the pasta until it is al dente, then rinse it, pour it back into the pot and put about 4 heaped TBL of pesto on top. Mix until the pasta is generously coated in pesto. You might want to add more for a more intense taste, but be careful as pesto is quite salty.
7.	Once the veg is ready, serve the pasta out and top with the roasted veg. You can also mix the veg and pasta to make a salad and eat this the next day or bring it along to a barbecue.
