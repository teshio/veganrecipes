If you want to switch to a vegan diet, it's really important to have a few go-to meals that you enjoy. I personally cook Indian or Asian dishes most of the time, because they're mostly vegan anyway or can be made vegan fairly easy. However, sometimes I do want to enjoy something that is closer to the European kitchen that I grew up with. Here I'll share a few of my favourite dishes. They range from energizing salads and pasta dishes to warming soups even a few treats.
